# Ocean Duo - README

## Overview

**Ocean Duo** is a game created in **Godot 4** for the **Pirate Software Game Jam 16**. The theme for the jam was "You are the weapon." In this game, you control two orbs that work together to help combat ocean pollution. The orbs are connected by a net, and the objective is to catch floating plastic debris while avoiding wildlife like fish and crabs, as well as dangerous sharp objects that damage your net.

## Gameplay

You control two orbs in the water, each with different movement controls:

- **Left orb**: Controlled with **AWSD keys**
- **Right orb**: Controlled with **Arrow keys**

Your goal is to catch the plastic debris floating in the water, but avoid catching the fish (sharks, clown fish and an exotic fish) and crabs. Also, watch out for sharp knives that damage your net!
Occasionally, you'll find a **new net** upgrade that improves your ability to catch more plastic. This can be a big help in your fight against pollution.
